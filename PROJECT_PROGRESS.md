# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Progress

**Current Status:**
*   **Data Loaded**: `creditcard.csv` loaded into pandas DataFrame.
*   **EDA Completed**: Identified severe class imbalance (0.17% fraudulent transactions). No missing values found.
*   **Data Preprocessing**:
    *   'Time' and 'Amount' features scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    *   Data split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, stratified to maintain class proportions.
    *   SMOTE applied to the training data to balance classes.
*   **Model Training & Evaluation**:
    *   Initial Logistic Regression model trained on resampled data.
    *   Evaluated on unseen test data: Achieved high recall for fraud (0.92) and high ROC AUC (0.97), but low precision (0.06) due to false positives.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Currently performing `GridSearchCV` on Logistic Regression to optimize performance, specifically aiming to improve precision while maintaining recall.

**Next Steps:**
*   Analyze the results of the hyperparameter tuning for the Logistic Regression model.
*   Based on tuning results, decide whether to further refine this model or explore other algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) for better precision-recall balance.
*   Prepare the final model for deployment as a web application on GitHub Pages (involves saving the model, creating an API, and developing a frontend).
